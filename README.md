# Web Scraping Discord Bot
Reads Through Amazon Listings using the Selenium library with Python.

HTML uses many unique identifiers such as ids, classes, and names. Using Xpath, we can find the exact path to a certain HTML object and retrieve its data. This is very useful on retailer websites such as Amazon so we can gather data on products such as their prices and ratings. A content creator on youtube might want to track the trajectory of the number of views or likes that their video gets so they may use Selenium to read and then analyze the trend. Upon using the command, the bot will send the first three listings and their respective prices for the item you are searching for. The command for this bot is $search item.
